Hospital Readmission Prediction is a multi-class classification problem addressing the prediction of the hospital readmission using cartographic features. The main aim of the project is to construct predictive models and then compare and evaluate their respective classification accuracies. The following are the tasks and goal associated with this project. The primary task would be to ensure the quality of the data via data cleansing. Post cleansing, dimensionality reduction (if required), feature Engineering, and sklearn packages would be used to build the models. One-vs-the-rest (OvR) classifier, a multiclass strategy would be used to train and test the model and the metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score and ROC Curve for each case would be recorded. 

The data set will be used to build classification models using various feasible supervised learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM, Random forests, KNN, Decision tree, Extra Tree and Bagging and semi-supervised learning algorithms like Label Propagation and Label Spreading. 

In addition, we build classification models using above supervised learning algorithms by choosing an target variable from the available set of features other than prescribed target variable to attain powerful insights of the data.
